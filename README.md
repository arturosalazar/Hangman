# Hangman
A simple game of hangman

The user will be prompted with an empty gallows and placeholders showing the number of letters in the word to guess. The user has 6 attempts to guess the letters in the word. If they guess correctly, the letter is shown in the correct place in the word. If they do not guess correctly, another part of the hanged person is drawn. 

If the user correctly guesses the word before the hanged person is fully drawn, they win. If they hanged person is fully drawn by then, they lose.

# Goal of Project
This project is for me to practice Java and creating a game on my own. It is also a way for me to practice making regular commits as I proceed with the creation of this project.
